# launcher

A simple system launcher using dmenu.  
Writes to a file ~/dlaunch.txt.

All scripts are without any kind of warranty, use entirely at your own risk!

On linux place into /user/local/bin/ and change permissions as follows: 
sudo chown root /user/local/bin/dlaunch.sh 
sudo chmod 755 /user/local/bin/dlaunch.sh 
sudo mv /user/local/bin/pcinfo.sh /user/local/bin/dlaunch

Dependancies: dmenu
sudo apt-get install dmenu
The Dmenu project is located here: https://tools.suckless.org/dmenu/

This tool is designed to be terminal only and extremely small with few dependencies. Some components do not work on weyland currently.
